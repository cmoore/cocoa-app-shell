# A Cocoa Test Application with Haskell

This project contains a test Cocoa application to demonstrate the usage of the `OBJC` Haskell typeclass.

A typical `OBJC` Haskell/Cocoa application would consist of:

* A GUI build with the "Interface Builder".

* A small Objective-C proxy controller: This is mainly for exporting the `IBOutlet`s to the Haskell controller and setting up the Haskell controller.

* A Haskell controller: This will be stateless and is basically a classical MVC controller.

* A Haskell model. 


## The `OBJC` typeclass

The typeclass deals with the conversion of Objective-C objects from/to Haskell values. For example there is an easy way to convert a `NSArray` to a Haskell list and vice versa.
